# myPortfolio
It is a small portfolio built using HTML and Tailwind CSS describing about me. It includes my projects,education experiences and a contact form. I really enjoyed building this project and specially the learning I got from this project was incredible. I discovered new features of Tailwind CSS in this project. Thanks to DevTown for their support.
